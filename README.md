# Password-Generator:lock:

Password-Generator's the second solo project for [JavaScript course on scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). It's a simple project that used knowledge about arrays, if-else statements, comparison and logical operators, for loops, the Math object, and returns statements. This project was created with additional requirements such as adding a "copy-on-click" for fields with passwords, adding abilities to set password length, and choosing what kind of characters we need to use (e.g. only alphabet characters or also use special symbols and numbers). I also added some changes on hover for button and other fields and icons that allow you to see which password was copied to your clipboard.

- Build it from "scratch"
